About this file:
As many things, this is just a first version of the real thing. As I am not a professional software developer (rather a self-taught bioinformatician), I still have to learn many ways of the Git. I am more than happy to do so via the contributions/help of the community!
A comprehensive "how to contribute" section and a general "code of conduct" section will be added later.
This file contains:
 - "Project status": do we have a release version? if major release version <1, we are still in pre-release phase. Please be gentle!
 - "How to contribute": if you find an error, have a clever idea how to improve this commandline tool intended for cfDNA sequencing data analysis (paired-end data only atm), or if you think the tool could benefit in other ways, please read this section carefully!
                        Any constructive contribution is well received and a place among the list of GCparagon contributors is yours!
 - "List of Contributors": the magnificent individuals who strive to make the world a better place, including through their contribution to this humble NGS data pre-processing tool!


Project status: pre-release (major release version = 0)


How to contribute:
!! THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!
Remember: always bump at least the "PATCH_NUMBER" in correct_GC_bias.py, README.md, and setup.py!
If you add a feature, please bump the MINOR_RELEASE.
