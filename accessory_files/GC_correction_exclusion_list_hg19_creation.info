regions added to ENCODE blacklist to be excluded during GC-bias computation:
 (basis: ENCODE blacklisted regions (accessory_files/bad_regions/hg19/hg19-ENCODE_blacklist.v2.bed))
 - telomeres (which are in general 10kb from each chromosome end; hg19_telomere.bed extracted from accessory_files/hg19/hg19.agp.gz)
 - centromeres (hg19_centromeres.bed extracted from accessory_files/bad_regions/hg19/hg19.agp.gz)
 - gaps caused by sequencing issues concerning heterochromatic DNA (hg19_heterochromatin.bed extracted from accessory_files/bad_regions/hg19/hg19.agp.gz)
 - gaps in short chromosome arms (hg19_shortArms.bed extracted from accessory_files/bad_regions/hg19/hg19.agp.gz)
 - UCSC gaps (hg19_gaps.bed; downloaded from UCSC table browser)
 - all alternate contigs (hg19_ALT.bed; extracted from the reference's *.chrom.sizes file)
 - PAR chrY (hg19_PAR_chrY.bed; info taken from https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg38&redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu;
             paragraph "Pseudoautosomal regions")
 - GRC incident regions from UCSC genome browser (table browser) with issues that haven't been marked as resolved: track name="GRC Incident Database"
   description="This track shows locations in the human assembly where assembly problems have been noted or resolved,
   as reported by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC)." (hg19_GRC_incident.bed); Size: 433,577,874 bases!!!
exclusion marked regions list creation commands:

	cat hg19_ENCODE_blacklist.v2.bed hg19_telomere.bed hg19_ALT.bed hg19_centromeres.bed hg19_GRC_incident.bed hg19_heterochromatin.bed hg19_PAR_chrY.bed hg19_shortArms.bed hg19_gaps.bed | \
	sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > hg19_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed && bedtools merge -o distinct -c 4 -i hg19_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed | \
	sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > hg19_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.merged.sorted.bed && rm hg19_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed

NOTE: the MERGE operation is of utmost importance! Otherwise the region exclusion code might count multi-countbases that are present in exclusion marked regions.

RESULT:	486,086,410 = 16.01% of hg19 (no chrY, chrM, only standard chromosome bases counted)
hg19 standard chromosomes (without chrM and chrY) minus hg19_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.merged.sorted.bed has --effectiveGenomeSize 2,550,217,436
