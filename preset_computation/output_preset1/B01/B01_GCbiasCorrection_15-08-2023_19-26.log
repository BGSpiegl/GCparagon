|   Configuration for processing sample B01 was:
|   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|   Using parameter preset 1 for analysis setup
|   Minimum fragment length: 20bp
|   Maximum fragment length: 550bp
|   Minimum number of specific fragment attribute combination occurrences: 2
|   Target number of fragments to process: 5,000,000 (expected to be reached)
|   Repetitions for simulation of expected GC-content per chunk: 6
|   Random seed was: 120
|   Temporary data will be written to: /mnt/NVMeScratch/NVMe_data/WGS_temp/temp_dir/B01
|   Final results will be moved from temporary path to directory: /mnt/Data/BPDP/GC_bias_correction/GC_correction_appNote/NARGAB_revision/GCparagon_sample_BAMs_GCparagon-GC-tagged/preset1/B01
