# first you need to sign the image:
singularity sign <YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>.sif

# in your remote endpoint, an active (not expired!) access token must exist!
# go to your remote endpoint, log in and check it! (like https://cloud.sylabs.io/tokens)
# tokens created on sylabs.io are valid for 30 days only. So you will likely have to create a new one.
# to activate the token for your remote endpoint locally, run:
singularity remote login
# then say you want to replace he token, if any already exists (might be expired) by typing:
y
# then paste the created access token using ctrl + v and press enter to confirm!

# In case no remote endpoint is available/has never been defined, you can add a remote endpoint using:
 singularity remote add <REMOTE_ENDPOINT>
# and follow other instructions on the command line. Don't forget to add an authentication token!

# Now, you should be able to push the sif to your remote endpoint (which must be active):
 singularity push gcparagon_<VERSION>-ubuntu-22_04-container_latest.sif library://bgspiegl/gcparagon/gcparagon_<VERSION>-ubuntu-22_04-container:latest
