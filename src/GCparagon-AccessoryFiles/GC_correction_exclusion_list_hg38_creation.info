regions added to ENCODE blacklist to be excluded during GC-bias computation:
 (basis: ENCODE blacklisted regions (hg38-ENCODE_blacklist.v2.bed))
 - N-masked gaps in the primary assembly of standard chromosomes (hg38_N_gaps.stdchroms.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - telomeres (which are in general 10kb from each chromosome end; hg38_10kbp_telomeres.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - gaps between contigs inside scaffolds (hg38_gaps_between_contigs.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - gaps between scaffolds in the chromosome assembly (hg38_gaps_between_scaffolds.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - centromeres (GRCh38_centromeres.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - gaps caused by sequencing issues concerning heterochromatic DNA (hg38_hetchrom.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - gaps in short chromosome arms (hg38_short_arm_gaps.bed extracted from hg38.agp.gz)
 - all alternate contigs (hg38_non_standard_contigs.bed extracted either from the reference's *.dict or *.chrom.sizes file)
 - PAR chrY (hg38_PAR_chrY.bed; info taken from http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg38&redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu; paragraph "Pseudoautosomal regions")
 - false duplications on standard-chromosomes from UCSC genome browser (added 14-11-2022): track name="GRC exclusions" description="regions in the GRCh38.p13 assembly declared by the GRC to represent contamination or a false duplication"
   #sequence	sequenceStart	sequenceEnd	exclusion
    chr21	5010000	5166246	false_duplication

 - GRC incident regions from UCSC genome browser (table browser) with issues that haven't been marked as resolved: track name="GRC Incident Database"
   description="This track shows locations in the human assembly where assembly problems have been noted or resolved,
   as reported by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC)." (hg38_GRC_incident.bed); Size: 310,320,042 bases!!!
   update 20.03.2024: removed a clone status problem that lead to removal of entire chr22

blacklist creation commands:

	cat hg38-ENCODE_blacklist.v2.bed hg38_N_gaps.stdchroms.bed hg38_10kbp_telomeres.bed hg38_gaps_between_scaffolds.bed \
	hg38_gaps_between_contigs.bed GRCh38_centromeres.bed hg38_hetchrom.bed hg38_non_standard_contigs.bed hg38_PAR_chrY.bed \
	hg38_short_arm_gaps.bed hg38_false_duplications.bed hg38_GRC_incident_chr22Debugged.bed | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > \
	hg38_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed && bedtools merge -o distinct -c 4 -i hg38_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed | \
	sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > hg38_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.merged.sorted.bed && rm hg38_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.sorted.bed

RESULT:	385,022,382 total bases = 12.68% of hg38 (which has 3,036,303,846 no chrY, chrM, only standard chromosome bases)
GRCh38 minus hg38_GCcorrection_ExclusionList.merged.sorted.bed has --effectiveGenomeSize 2,651,281,464
